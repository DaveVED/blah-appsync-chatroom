# Blah

Blah is an open-source _communications platform_ built in _TypeScript_ with _JavaScript runtimes_ such as _Node.js_ and _Bun_.

Originally built to explore [_AWS AppSync Serverless WebSockets_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/what-is-aurora-dsql.html), _Blah_ started as a simple idea—a _global chat_ where _anyone_ from _anywhere_ could connect. But, it quickly grew into much more as _my needs_ expanded and my _curiosity_ to _explore new AWS services_ kicked in, as _re:Invent_ was happening at the time (_December 2024_). So naturally _Blah_ also now uses more _new_ services such as [_Aurora DSQL_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/what-is-aurora-dsql.html)
